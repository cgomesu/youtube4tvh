# Youtube 4 TVH
Youtube 4 TVH is a non-interactive CLI Python program that uses Youtube API to 
find live-streams and create (or update) m3u playlists with them. The m3u file 
follows IPTV conventions that allow a TVHeadend server to create an IPTV network 
with them, and each stream is piped into TVHeadend via a Streamlink 
(https://streamlink.github.io/) shell script.
